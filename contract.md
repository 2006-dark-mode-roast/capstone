social contract
*This document describes our team social contract for this project*
Reference Establishing Norms
Roles
Taskmaster - Yosef
Gitmaster - Josh
Testmaster - Angela
None for now - Robert
Daily process
Morning standup (10:30AM or after morning session) started by yesterday's Taskmaster
New roles assigned every few days (by yesterday’s Taskmaster)
Yesterday? Today? Obstacles? (by today’s Taskmaster)
Pull party (?)
Potential pair programs if needed
Record issues that are non-blocking and discuss right after lunch at re-group meeting
Bring up any blocking issues after 30 minutes of spinning your wheels
Team expectations
Nights and weekends
Communication of what we are working on outside of standard hours
All team members open to scheduling time as needed
If you have a blocking issue, slack before interrupting another’s train of coding-thought
Order of escalation:
Single teammate
Team
Fellow (Desi)
Instructor (Sarah)
We will assign tasks vertically (“slices”)
None of us will specialize in terms of front-end and back-end code
Don’t interrupt - raise your hand
Share the mic
Disagree often and discuss -- argue infrequently
At least message the group when you change what you are working on
Issues
If the group is divided on a certain decision we will take the following steps:
Take 10-15 minute break
List out the pros / cons
Vote on it
If the vote is split, escalate to a fellow or instructor
If you are frustrated
Take a walk or get some water
Talk constructively about actionable items (e.g. raise your hand instead of interrupting, let me learn and struggle until I ask you for help, etc.)
Bring in a 3rd party (e.g. fellow, instructor) to mediate if you feel too frustrated
